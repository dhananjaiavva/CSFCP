Computer Science Fundamentals: Linux Scripting

This repository contains the required artifacts for the Computer Science Fundamentals assignment focusing on Linux operating system utilization and advanced shell scripting. The submission is designed to formally document proficiency in system administration and automation.

The core submission is the Detailed Report (linux assignment), which analyzes over 20 foundational Linux commands, covering their syntax, rationale, and implementation with verifiable snapshots.

The assignment also includes three developed shell scripts demonstrating functional automation:

script1.sh (Directory Backup): Copies a specified directory to a timestamped archival folder for version control.

script2.sh (Resource Monitoring): Logs real-time CPU and memory usage to a file at regular intervals for system diagnostics.

script3.sh (Automated Download Task): Utilizes wget or curl to securely fetch a file from a URL and store it in a predefined directory.

All script source codes, implementation evidence (output images), and a detailed technical reflection are included in this package.
